                hi this is <i>Faith</i>. I am a programmer who is interested in the stages of development cycle including [user experience design], [graphic design], and [software development].

                <br><br>

                recently I:
                <br>
                • baked blueberry macaroons for the first time to share with friends – they were finicky but turned out surprisingly well
                <br>
                • am teaching myself drumming
                <br>
                • am bonding with certain languages on a deeper level... hints of who they are can be found on homepage around the <i>corner</i> (pun intended)
